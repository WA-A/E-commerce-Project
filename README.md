# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- It is the second and final project in React and the end of the Front End with the Knowledge Academy that contains several ideas, such as creating categories for the user, logging in, logging out, creating an account, Validate, confirming the email, and changing the password. When the user logs into his account, his information is displayed, and he can enter the products page, choose from it, view its details and pictures, add it to the cart, review, and other advanced ideas and the project. It was dealing with a real API through env ,mainly working on SPI and dealing with context

Several libraries were used such as formik\yup\Toast\jwt\react query\swiper\react-image-magnify and many more
